Welcome to the first public version of GlitchHelper!
This version is for review purposes only. Feel free to use it in private and tell me what needs improving, but don't go sharing it around just yet.
After the review period, it will be released under either GPL3.0, or AGPL3.0.

- On both FormMain and HotfileManager I have a tab called "Edit", but I'm really not sure what I should put there/if I should even have it.
- I'm not sure how good my file/folder structure is, nor am I entirly confident that I'm using good naming conventions.
- The is one feature that is currently missing from this build, and that's the Header Editor. The reason it's missing is because I'm not entirly sure what the best way to go about making it is... Forcing each plugin to have it's own form would be too clunky, forcing each plugin to have its own set of buttons that would get added to a dedicated form might be ok, or I could just have another DataGridView that plugins can add cells too. Any suggestions?
